# wetLabProtocols <!-- omit in toc -->

Descriptive protocols for different types of wet-lab experiments. PDF versions of all protocols are available for download in the same directory where the protocol is found. For protocols with code blocks, the PDF version may have some of the code cut off for long lines, so I suggest you refer to the markdown version in these cases.

**FOR ALL PROTOCOLS** - refer to the health and safety guidelines of your own institute, as well as the MSDS documents for the described chemicals before use. Some of the chemicals and objects used are dangerous and should be handled with caution.

## Troubleshooting

While these protocols have been validated to work in my hands, use at your own risk. If you have any issues or notice errors in anything that you find here, feel free to make a post in the [Issues](https://github.com/chrishuges/wetLabProtocols/issues) and I will do my best to address it.
